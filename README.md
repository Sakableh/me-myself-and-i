# Steps ▶️

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio
```

```bash
# Go into the repository
$ cd astro-bento-portfolio
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm install
or
$ npm install
```

```bash
# Start the project in development
$ pnpm run dev
or
$ npm run dev
```

# Customize your portfolio
After installing dependencies, run:

```bash
$ pnpm run site-setup
```

This updates `src/site-config.ts` (name, links, email, timezone, etc.) and sets `SITE_URL` in `.env`.

Then start the dev server again (`pnpm run dev`).

Even after `site-setup`, you still need to swap the avatar/memoji images (replace `src/assets/me*.webp` with your own).

## REMOVE THE umami analytics script tag (or replace it with your id) in `src/layouts/BasicLayout.astro`

# Configuration

`site` and sitemap/robots URLs are derived from `SITE_URL`.

# Deploy on Netlify 🚀

Deploying your website on Netlify it's optional but I reccomand it in order to deploy it faster and easly.

You just need to fork this repo and linking it to your Netlify account.
